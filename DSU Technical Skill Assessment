Context:
The world population is projected to hit 8 billion this year. 
We’ve provided a dataset with population information for 234 countries/territories.
We’ve processed it a tiny bit to make some operations easier. 
Each row contains information about a country: its capital, land area, population density, and 
raw population counts over 10-year intervals starting at 1970.


Notes:
- The dataset provided was taken from Kaggle. 

1. According to the data, which country had the highest population in 1980? What was its exact unrounded population? Explain how you got your answer.
SELECT Country, MAX("1980 Population") FROM BIT_DB.Worldpopulation;

2. According to the data, what was the exact unrounded world population in 1980? Explain how you got your answer.
SELECT SUM("1980 Population") FROM BIT_DB.Worldpopulation;

3. According to the data, which country has the longest capital name (including spaces)? What’s the name of its capital? Explain how you got your answer.
SELECT Country, Capital FROM BIT_DB.Worldpopulation
ORDER BY length (Capital) DESC;
 
4. According to the data, what is the average population density of countries which start with the letter “a” in 2022? 
SELECT AVG("Density (per km²)") FROM BIT_DB.Worldpopulation
WHERE Country LIKE 'a%';
